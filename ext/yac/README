DESCRIPTION

Suppose the simplest topology with a cycle -- a single switch with two ports connected to each other.
There are a number of hosts, connected through other ports. The switch is under your POX controller.

How to get some fun with this topo?

This application iterates all host traffic through the cycle for a given number of times.
What is more, this number is configurable for each sender-receiver pair.
